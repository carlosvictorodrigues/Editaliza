/**
 * CONCLUSION:
 * 
 * This analysis recommends a phased approach starting with high-impact, 
 * low-complexity improvements that directly address user pain points. 
 * The total investment of R$572,500 over 24 months is projected to 
 * generate R$1,498,080 in annual benefits, representing a 162% ROI 
 * in year one alone.
 * 
 * The strategy balances user satisfaction improvements with revenue 
 * optimization, creating a sustainable growth trajectory for Editaliza 
 * in the competitive Brazilian concurso preparation market.
 * 
 * Priority should be given to manual controls, algorithm transparency, 
 * and enhanced onboarding as these offer the highest ROI with the 
 * lowest execution risk.
